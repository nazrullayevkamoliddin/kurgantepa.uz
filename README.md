## Overview 

A government website is an online platform that provides citizens with access to a wide range of information and services related to their local, state, or federal government. These websites typically include information on government programs, policies, and initiatives, as well as resources for citizens such as forms, applications, and online services. Government websites may also include news and updates, as well as information on elected officials and government agencies. Users can often search for information on specific topics or browse through categories such as health, education, and transportation. Additionally, government websites may provide resources for businesses, such as procurement opportunities and information on regulations and permits. The primary goal of government websites is to provide citizens with easy access to information and services that can help them engage with and participate in their government.
